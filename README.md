Sudoku Solver w/ Variable Ordering and Forward Checking
This project solves a standard Sudoku game using multiple variable-ordering and inference methods. 
Through implementation of a few uninformed static variable-ordering functions, it is clear that informed searches 
like Minimum Remaining Values and forward checking drastically cut down the space complexity of the search problem, 
in this case, our Sudoku board.
